      <h1>Where Grit Meets Opportunity</h1>
      <p>Launched in July 2013, Level Ground leverages Mixed Martial Arts to unleash the strength, power, and ingenuity of urban youth to fight for and seize their dreams. We are currently operating in Roxbury and Dorchester, and focus on serving youth who are exposed to a disproportionate level
        of violence, poverty, and lack of access to education.</p>

    <h1 class="secondh">WHY</h1>
    <p>We couple our athletic training with professional mentorship, academic advancement, and youth employment. We currently operate in three schools and one evening program, our “Roxbury Home Base.” Level Ground links its students to college, workforce development programs, and jobs so
      that they are positioned to achieve a meaningful career.</p>
